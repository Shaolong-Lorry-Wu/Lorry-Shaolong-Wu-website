abstract: In the labor market of the United States, a wide range of
  socioeconomic and demographic factors impact workersâ€™ income and decisions to
  seek new jobs, which are two critical metrics of labor income dynamics.
  Studies of income dynamics have historically been examining major demographic
  and situational factors such as marital and family matters of Americans from
  the 1960s to 2000s. However, technological breakthroughs have drastically
  changed the landscape of the labor force and economy, and individuals face a
  more complex and diverse context. This paper recognizes the need to analyze
  the factors behind these two income dynamics metrics in the contemporary
  setting. This paper confirms that the wages and other types of income of the
  cohort (born in 1980s and 1990s) in the United States are explained by
  personal demographics, living habits, and family background conditions. This
  paper also finds a series of factors, such as region, marital status, and
  education, to be significant in determining whether individuals will seek a
  new full-time job over time. This paper limits itself to predictive and
  forensic analysis and leaves the question of job search motivations to authors
  of related areas.
